Assignment 2 - CS267

NOTE: THIS IS OUT OF DATE. WILL UPDATE SOON

Usage
-----------
Note that the PGI compiler suite is expected to be used.

Take advantage of Hopper's many cores per CPU to compile faster. From the root directory, run

	make -j24

This should populate the bin/ directory with executables. The bin directory also contains job files for scheduling the executables for running on Hopper, and job files for running the autograder.
